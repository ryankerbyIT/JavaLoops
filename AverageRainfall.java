/**
 * Explanation:
	The program asks the user for the number of years, and then 
	for each monthâ€™s rainfall. Input validation ensures that the 
	number of years is at least 1 and that rainfall values are 
	non-negative. After gathering all the rainfall data, the 
	program calculates and displays the total months, total 
	rainfall, and average monthly rainfall.
