### 1. Sum of Numbers
This program asks the user to enter a positive nonzero integer. It then calculates and displays the sum of all the numbers from 1 up to the entered value.

**Usage:**
```bash
javac SumOfNumbers.java
java SumOfNumbers
```

### 2. Distance Traveled
This program calculates the distance a vehicle travels for each hour of a given time period based on user input for speed and time.

**Usage:**
```bash
javac DistanceTraveled.java
java DistanceTraveled
```

### 3. Distance File
This is a modification of the Distance Traveled project. Instead of displaying the output to the console, the program writes the distance traveled for each hour to a text file.

**Usage:**
```bash
javac DistanceFile.java
java DistanceFile
```

### 4. Pennies for Pay
This program calculates the total salary earned over a given number of days if the salary starts with one penny and doubles each day. The output is shown in dollar format.

**Usage:**
```bash
javac PenniesForPay.java
java PenniesForPay
```

### 5. Letter Counter
This program asks the user to enter a string and a character. It counts and displays how many times the character appears in the string.

**Usage:**
```bash
javac LetterCounter.java
java LetterCounter
```

### 6. File Letter Counter
This program reads from a file, asks the user for a character, and then counts how many times the character appears in the file.

**Usage:**
```bash
javac FileLetterCounter.java
java FileLetterCounter
```

### 7. Hotel Occupancy
This program calculates the occupancy rate of a hotel by asking the user for the number of floors, rooms per floor, and the number of rooms that are occupied. It then calculates and displays the occupancy rate.

**Usage:**
```bash
javac HotelOccupancy.java
java HotelOccupancy
```

### 8. Average Rainfall
This program calculates the average rainfall over a given number of years by asking for rainfall data for each month.

**Usage:**
```bash
javac AverageRainfall.java
java AverageRainfall
```

### 9. Population Growth
This program predicts the size of a population based on an initial population size, a daily population growth rate, and the number of days for growth. The program uses loops to calculate the population growth over time.

**Usage:**
```bash
javac PopulationGrowth.java
java PopulationGrowth
```

### 10. Largest and Smallest
This program asks the user to enter a series of integers and determines the largest and smallest numbers in the series. The user enters -99 to indicate the end of input.

**Usage:**
```bash
javac LargestAndSmallest.java
java LargestAndSmallest
```

### 11. Celsius to Fahrenheit Table
This program displays a table converting Celsius temperatures from 0 to 20 to their Fahrenheit equivalents using a for loop.

**Usage:**
```bash
javac CelsiusToFahrenheit.java
java CelsiusToFahrenheit
```

### 12. Bar Chart
This program generates a simple bar chart based on sales figures entered for five stores. Each bar represents sales using asterisks, with each asterisk representing $100.

**Usage:**
```bash
javac BarChart.java
java BarChart
```

### 13. Dice Game
This is a simple game where the user competes against the computer by rolling dice. The game runs for 10 rounds, and the program keeps track of how many times each side wins.

**Usage:**
```bash
javac DiceGame.java
java DiceGame
```

### 14. Slot Machine Simulation
This program simulates a slot machine. The user enters an amount of money, and the program generates random results for a slot machine. If two or more results match, the user wins.

**Usage:**
```bash
javac SlotMachineSimulation.java
java SlotMachineSimulation
```

### 15. Random Number Guessing Game
The program generates a random number and allows the user to guess it. The user receives feedback whether the guess is too high or too low until they guess correctly.

**Usage:**
```bash
javac RandomNumberGuessingGame.java
java RandomNumberGuessingGame
```

### 16. ESP Game
This game tests the userâ€™s ESP (extrasensory perception). The computer randomly selects a color from a list, and the user has to guess which color was selected.

**Usage:**
```bash
javac ESPGame.java
java ESPGame
```

### 17. Square Display
This program asks the user to enter a positive integer no greater than 15 and displays a square made of X characters of that size.

**Usage:**
```bash
javac SquareDisplay.java
java SquareDisplay
```

### 18. Personal Web Page Generator
This program asks the user for their name and a description. It generates a basic HTML page that displays this information.

**Usage:**
```bash
javac PersonalWebPageGenerator.java
java PersonalWebPageGenerator
```
