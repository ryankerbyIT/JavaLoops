### 1. Sum of Numbers
This program asks the user to enter a positive nonzero integer. It then calculates and displays the sum of all the numbers from 1 up to the entered value.

**Usage:**
```bash
javac SumOfNumbers.java
java SumOfNumbers
2. Distance Traveled
This program calculates the distance a vehicle travels for each hour of a given time period based on user input for speed and time.

Usage:

bash
Copy code
javac DistanceTraveled.java
java DistanceTraveled
3. Distance File
This is a modification of the Distance Traveled project. Instead of displaying the output to the console, the program writes the distance traveled for each hour to a text file.

Usage:

bash
Copy code
javac DistanceFile.java
java DistanceFile
4. Pennies for Pay
This program calculates the total salary earned over a given number of days if the salary starts with one penny and doubles each day. The output is shown in dollar format.

Usage:

bash
Copy code
javac PenniesForPay.java
java PenniesForPay
5. Letter Counter
This program asks the user to enter a string and a character. It counts and displays how many times the character appears in the string.

Usage:

bash
Copy code
javac LetterCounter.java
java LetterCounter
6. File Letter Counter
This program reads from a file, asks the user for a character, and then counts how many times the character appears in the file.

Usage:

bash
Copy code
javac FileLetterCounter.java
java FileLetterCounter
7. Hotel Occupancy
This program calculates the occupancy rate of a hotel by asking the user for the number of floors, rooms per floor, and the number of rooms that are occupied. It then calculates and displays the occupancy rate.

Usage:

bash
Copy code
javac HotelOccupancy.java
java HotelOccupancy
8. Average Rainfall
This program calculates the average rainfall over a given number of years by asking for rainfall data for each month.

Usage:

bash
Copy code
javac AverageRainfall.java
java AverageRainfall
9. Population Growth
This program predicts the size of a population based on an initial population size, a daily population growth rate, and the number of days for growth. The program uses loops to calculate the population growth over time.

Usage:

bash
Copy code
javac PopulationGrowth.java
java PopulationGrowth
10. Largest and Smallest
This program asks the user to enter a series of integers and determines the largest and smallest numbers in the series. The user enters -99 to indicate the end of input.

Usage:

bash
Copy code
javac LargestAndSmallest.java
java LargestAndSmallest
11. Celsius to Fahrenheit Table
This program displays a table converting Celsius temperatures from 0 to 20 to their Fahrenheit equivalents using a for loop.

Usage:

bash
Copy code
javac CelsiusToFahrenheit.java
java CelsiusToFahrenheit
12. Bar Chart
This program generates a simple bar chart based on sales figures entered for five stores. Each bar represents sales using asterisks, with each asterisk representing $100.

Usage:

bash
Copy code
javac BarChart.java
java BarChart
13. Dice Game
This is a simple game where the user competes against the computer by rolling dice. The game runs for 10 rounds, and the program keeps track of how many times each side wins.

Usage:

bash
Copy code
javac DiceGame.java
java DiceGame
14. Slot Machine Simulation
This program simulates a slot machine. The user enters an amount of money, and the program generates random results for a slot machine. If two or more results match, the user wins.

Usage:

bash
Copy code
javac SlotMachineSimulation.java
java SlotMachineSimulation
15. Random Number Guessing Game
The program generates a random number and allows the user to guess it. The user receives feedback whether the guess is too high or too low until they guess correctly.

Usage:

bash
Copy code
javac RandomNumberGuessingGame.java
java RandomNumberGuessingGame
16. ESP Game
This game tests the userâ€™s ESP (extrasensory perception). The computer randomly selects a color from a list, and the user has to guess which color was selected.

Usage:

bash
Copy code
javac ESPGame.java
java ESPGame
17. Square Display
This program asks the user to enter a positive integer no greater than 15 and displays a square made of X characters of that size.

Usage:

bash
Copy code
javac SquareDisplay.java
java SquareDisplay
18. Personal Web Page Generator
This program asks the user for their name and a description. It generates a basic HTML page that displays this information.

Usage:

bash
Copy code
javac PersonalWebPageGenerator.java
java PersonalWebPageGenerator
